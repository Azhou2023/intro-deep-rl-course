Text adventure games predate computers with graphics. However, in many ways they are more complex than conventional video games because they can involve complicated interactions (e.g., \"build a rope bridge\") that require a fair amount of imagination. Indeed, text adventure games are used as [research testbeds](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.05398) for natural language processing agents.\n","\n","The canonical text adventure game is [Zork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zork), in which the player discover an abandoned underworld realm full of treasure. You can find online playable versions.\n","\n","A text game is made up of individual locations--also called \"rooms\", though they need not be indoor enclosed spaces as the term might imply. The agent can move between rooms and interact with objects by typing in short commands like \"move north\" and \"take lamp\".\n","\n","In this assignment, we will use a special package that implements text worlds for testing agents: [TextWorld-Express](https://github.com/cognitiveailab/TextWorldExpress). Textworld-Express simplifies text worlds in a few ways: it uses a reduced set of text commands, and rooms laid out in a grid.\n","TextWorld-Express also implements a few different game objectives, such as cooking, and searching for coins.\n","TextWorld-Express generates world configurations, so we will need to implement algorithms that are able to complete different game objectives in different world configurations.\n","\n","In this assignment, our agents will play two different games:\n","- Coin Game: a  game in which the agent must search for and pick up a single coin.\n","- Map Reader: a game in which the agent must find a key and return it to a box at the starting location.\n","\n","**We will be implementing the tabular Q-learning algorithm** (as opposed to neural Q-learning).\n","\n","You are prohibited from using any pre-existing python package with built-in graph functions such as Djikstra's algorithm, or Prim's algorithm (e.g., networkx and SciPy). You are prohibited from using any python package that does not come default with Python, except textworld-express, graphviz, and pydot, which are loaded as part of this notebook.\n","\n","**Notes:**\n","- If you break execution of a cell running the game engine, you may put TextWorld-Express in an un-recoverable state. If this happens, you will need to reset your kernel/runtime.\n","- In the Map Reader game, you must use a single search loop (you cannot run a search to the coin and then a separate search to the box). You cannot write specialized code for handling the Map Reader game. You cannot memorize the path to the coin and then reverse it.\n","- In the Map Reader game, you cannot use the map information.\n","- You cannot filter any actions. We've already filtered out the actions that we don't want your agent to have to consider. For example, the \"take map\" action is never helpful, but you must explore it.\n","- ***DO NOT REMOVE ANY COMMENTS THAT HAVE `# EXPORT` IN THEM.
